## Overview
<img src="resources/images/whole-body-parts-visualization.png" alt="overview" width="100%">

CADS is an open-source project for comprehensive whole-body CT segmentation, consisting of two main components:

1. **Large-scale label set**: 
   - Annotations for 22,022 CT volumes collected from publicly available datasets and private hospital data, spanning 100+ imaging centers across 16 countries
   - 167 anatomical structures covering major body regions
   - Built through an innovative automatic pipeline with pseudo-labeling and unsupervised quality control

2. **Automatic segmentation models**: 
   - A family of open-source deep learning models for automatic whole-body segmentation
   - Trained on our diverse CT collection
   - Extensively validated on both public challenges and real-world hospital data

This project aims to provide the medical imaging community with both a diverse dataset and robust, generalizable, ready-to-use segmentation models that aim to improve AI in clinical standards.

pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start
Example script for running inference using the `predict()` function:

```python
python cads/scripts/predict_images.py \
    -in "/path/to/ct_images" \  # Directory containing .nii.gz CT files
    -out "/path/to/output" \    # Output directory
    -model "/path/to/models" \  # Directory containing model weights
    --preprocessing \           # Enable preprocessing (keep this flag)
    --postprocessing \         # Enable postprocessing (keep this flag)
    -task "551" \              # Model task ID (551-559, or 'all')
    -np 4 \                    # Number of preprocessing threads
    -ns 6                      # Number of threads for saving files
```
