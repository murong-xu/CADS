## Overview
<img src="resources/images/whole-body-parts-visualization.png" alt="overview" width="100%">

CADS is a robust, fully automated framework for segmenting 167 anatomical structures in Computed Tomography (CT), spanning from head to knee regions across diverse anatomical systems.

The framework consists of two main components:

1. **CADS-dataset**: 
   - 22,022 CT volumes with complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures.
   - Most extensive whole-body CT dataset, exceeding current collections in both scale (18x more CT scans) and anatomical coverage (60% more distinct targets).
   - Data collected from publicly available datasets and private hospital data, spanning 100+ imaging centers across 16 countries.
   - Diverse coverage of clinical variability, protocols, and pathological conditions.
   - Built through an automated pipeline with pseudo-labeling and unsupervised quality control.

2. **CADS-model**: 
   - An open-source model suite for automated whole-body segmentation.
   - Performance validated on both public challenges and real-world hospital cohorts.
   - Available as Python script run (this GitHub repo) for flexible command-line usage.
   - Also available as a user-friendly 3D Slicer plugin with UI interface, simple installation and one-click inference.

## Installation

Below we provide instructions for Python script run. For 3D Slicer plugin installation, please refer to [SlicerCADSWholeBodyCTSeg](https://github.com/murong-xu/SlicerCADSWholeBodyCTSeg).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:murong-xu/CADS.git
# or download from https://github.com/murong-xu/CADS

# 2. Create and activate conda environment (Python>=3.9 required)
conda create -n CADS_env python=3.11
conda activate CADS_env

# 3. Install PyTorch
# Visit https://pytorch.org/ and select the appropriate version based on your Operating System and CUDA version
# Browse previous releases here if you prefer not to install the latest version: https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
# CADS requirement: torch>=2.1.2
# Example installation command for Linux with CUDA 12.4:
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# 4. Install CADS
cd CADS  # the cloned git repo
pip install -e .

# Note: During installation, you may see warnings about "DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install".
# This warning is expected and can be safely ignored - it doesn't affect the functionality of CADS.
```

## Quick Start
Example script for running inference:

```bash
python cads/scripts/predict_images.py \
    -in "/path/to/ct_images" \    # Input directory containing CT images (.nii.gz format)
    -out "/path/to/output" \      # Output directory for segmentation results
    -task "all"                   # Task ID options:
                                  #   - "all": run all tasks
                                  #   - single task: choose from 551-559
                                  #   (see "Target Structures in Each Task" section below)
```
